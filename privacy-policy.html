                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>Last updated: August 7, 2024</p>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Welcome to Go Go GAIA, a health management app developed by Holland Neurotech Inc. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app and services.</p>

                <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>We only collect and store data that you manually log into the app. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal Identification Information: such as your email address used for login and authentication purposes, stored securely in Firebase.</li>
                    <li>Health Data: such as sleep patterns, mood fluctuations, menstrual cycles, blood sugar levels, and any other health-related information you manually log, stored in AWS.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. How We Collect Information</h3>
                <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information Provided by You: All data you manually enter into the app.</li>
                    <li>Wearable and Apple Health Data: Accessed directly from your device but not stored or transmitted through our API.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>
                <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide and maintain the app.</li>
                    <li>Personalize your user experience based on the data you enter.</li>
                    <li>Improve the app based on user feedback and logged data.</li>
                    <li>Communicate with you for support and updates.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. How We Share Your Information</h3>
                <p>We do not share your data with any third parties. Your data is stored securely, and access is limited to necessary personnel only.</p>

                <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
                <p>We take the security of your data seriously. Your email address used for login is stored in Firebase, while your health data is stored in AWS. Only someone with access to both databases could link the two, ensuring an additional layer of security.</p>

                <h3>6. Data Retention</h3>
                <p>We retain your data as long as you maintain an account with us. If you choose to delete your account, your data will be permanently deleted from our servers.</p>

                <h3>7. Your Data Protection Rights</h3>
                <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access: Request access to your personal data.</li>
                    <li>Correction: Request corrections to inaccurate data.</li>
                    <li>Deletion: Request deletion of your data.</li>
                    <li>Restriction: Request restriction of data processing.</li>

                </ul>
